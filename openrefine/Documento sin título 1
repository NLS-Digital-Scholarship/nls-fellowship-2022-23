Hi Gavin,

It is a pleasure to meet you. Thank you very for receiving me.

At the moment, I am available the 15th in the afternoon, would it work for example 15:00?

Thanks in advance.

Best wishes,

Hi Sarah (and Gustavo)

 

Thanks for the email introduction – I’d be really keen to meet up. I’m currently free most of the afternoon of the 15th so please just let me know a time that would suit.

 

Best wishes

 

Gavin
